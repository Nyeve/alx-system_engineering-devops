0. OSI model

mandatory

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.



It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:



The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal

The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc

Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.







In this project we will mainly focus on:



The Transport layer and especially TCP/UDP

On the Network layer with IP and ICMP

The image bellow describes more concretely how you can relate to every level.







Questions:



What is the OSI model?



Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect

The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology

The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology

How is the OSI model organized?



Alphabetically

From the lowest to the highest level

2. MAC and IP address

mandatory





Questions:



What is a MAC address?



The name of a network interface

The unique identifier of a network interface

A network interface

What is an IP address?



Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses

The unique identifier of a network interface

Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks

3. UDP and TCP

mandatory





Let’s fill the empty parts in the drawing above.



Questions:



Which statement is correct for the TCP box:

It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely

It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process

Which statement is correct for the UDP box:

It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely

It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process

Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:

Have you received boxes x, y, z?

May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?
